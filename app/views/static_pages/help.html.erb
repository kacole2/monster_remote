    <h2>HELP! Zombies are after my brains!</h2>

    <p>
    	<b>Why are there no buttons on the MonsterRemote home page?</b><br>
    	The <%= link_to 'MonsterRemote', :home %> home page responds to the MonsterShield settings page. If the slots are enabled on the settings page, then you will
    	see a button to trigger that slot on the home page. If the buttons are not appearing, go to the Settings -> MonsterShield Settings page.
    	The MonsterShield settings page will send a call to the MonsterShield to return back which slots are enabled or disabled.
    	If the settings page has "false" for every slot, refresh the page and then allow the MonsterShield to refresh the MonsterRemote settings.
  	</p>

    	<b>Why does my Pi seem slow to respond to my commands?</b><br>
    	Well, you are running on a Raspberry Pi. It's not the Pi that's can't understand your commands, it's the MonsterShield that might be running commands
    	 and your request got lost or is in the queue. When slot 0 is set in ambient mode, there is probably more of a chance that something got lost in the mix.
